## philosophy

The modern web has been leveraged by corporations to commercialize their
products and services.  Many corporations exist primarily because of their web apps.
We have no issue with the commercialization of the web.  However, we are more
aligned with products and services that promote human communication and
collaboration.  Most of these services don't require modern web technologies.

While we still intend on building web sites, we take a more thoughtful approach to
building them.  

One thing we have noticed is the ever-expanding number of features that get added 
to a project over time.  Without restraint, projects quickly expand until they 
require a team to maintain. 

## goals

- Building a smaller web
- Building libraries to support a smaller web
- Keeping projects limited in scope and features
- Fostering a community of hackers who enjoy minimalism
