## philosophy

The modern web has been leveraged by corporations to commercialize their
products and services.  Many corporations exist primarily because of their web apps.
We have no issue with the commercialization of the web.  However, we are more
aligned with products and services that promote human communication and
collaboration.  Most of these services don't require modern web technologies.

While we still intend on build web sites, we take a thoughtful approach to
building them.  The projects we build will have extreme restraints when it
comes to scope and feature-set.  One thing we have noticed is the ever-growing
number of features that get baked into a project until a team is required to
maintain over time.  We want to take a different approach: we want to apply the
unix philosophy to our projects which means that they should only do one thing
and do it well.

## goals

- Building a smaller web
- Building libraries to support a smaller web
- Keep projects limited in scope and features
